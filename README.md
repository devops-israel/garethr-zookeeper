A Puppet module for managing the installation of Zookeeper from
Cloudera.
[![Build
Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/garethr/garethr-zookeeper.png)](http://travis-ci.org/garethr/garethr-zookeeper)

# Usage

For the moment this is as simple as

    include zookeeper

All other configuration is down to you.

# Requirements

You'll need the wget and java modules (or similarly named and
functioning modules) to provide dependencies for either the build or
running of zookeeper.
